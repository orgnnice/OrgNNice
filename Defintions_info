Note:

to attachements in the database:

Create Statement for attachement:

create table IF NOT EXISTS attachement (pk_id INTEGER primary key  AUTOINCREMENT, filename varchar(100))");

filename is the name the file had on the user's file system.
we proceed to copy this file to resources folder. the filename in this folder is id_filedname. This ensures, that two files havong the same name is not a problem.

Example: User selects homework.doc and attatches it to a WrittenNote.
the Note gets inserted into the database and the assigned id is 57.
Then homework.doc gets copied to the resources-folder with the name 57_homework.doc

There still is the problem, that 2 identical files could end up in the resources folder, which is not good regarding used space on the disk.


<todo> To solve that problem a md5-hash could be saved in the database as well and on every insert, the md5-hash would be compared to those in teh database already.

However in the current state of Developement, our focus os not on details like that.
